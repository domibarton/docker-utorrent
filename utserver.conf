# This file is configuration setting for uTorrent for Linux. If you're making
# changes to an existing config file, be sure to delete or rename the settings 
# files. They'll be recreated upon startup.
#
# Many of these settings are only read from the configuration file when the
# uTorrent settings file settings.dat does not already exist in the settings
# directory. Once settings.dat exists, the values specified in the configuration
# file for these settings will be ignored, and the values stored in settings.dat
# will be used. For other settings, the server will load the values from the
# configuration file every time the program starts or receives a request to
# reload the configuration file.
#
# The settings for which the values are always applied from the configuration
# file when the file is read by the server include:
#
#    dir_request, disk_cache_max_size, finish_cmd, logmask,
#    preferred_interface, state_cmd, uconnect_enable, uconnect_password,
#    uconnect_username, ut_webui_dir
#
# Sample command line that uses this config file
# ./utserver -settingspath /opt/utorrent -configfile /opt/utorrent/utserver.conf
#
 
# bind_ip (string): The IP address to use for socket connections. If not provided, a 
# default IP address will be used. We do not recommend changing this value.
#
# bind_ip: 127.0.0.1
 
# ut_webui_port (integer): The default value is 8080. Port number where the utserver 
# process accepts HTTP RPC API calls to support the uTorrent-compatible HTTP interface. 
# If the utserver process also serves HTML files (see webui_server_files setting), 
# also the port of HTTP server.
#
ut_webui_port: 8080
 
# token_auth_enable (boolean): The default value is true. If true, the uTorrent 
# HTTP interface defends against cross-site request forgeries by requiring that a 
# short-lived token be obtained from the uTorrent HTTP interface and included at the 
# beginning of the parameter list of any request made to that interface. If false, 
# the uTorrent HTTP interface will not be protected in this manner.
#
token_auth_enable: true
 
# Directory in which currently downloaded data is saved. Can be an absolute path or 
# a relative path. If it is a relative path, the value is relative to dir_root or the 
# current working directory if dir_root is not defined or an empty string. It is 
# recommended that this directory be hidden from users (i.e. not exported through
# Samba).
#
dir_active: /shared/download
 
# Directory where completed downloads are stored. If the value is an empty string, 
# the value of dir_active is used. This value must represent a path that is accessible 
# to users (e.g. exported through Samba). It also has to be on the same volume as 
# dir_active.
#
dir_completed: /shared/done
 
# Optional directory where completed downloads can be stored, instead of in 
# dir_completed. If no value is specified for this setting, the value of dir_completed 
# is used. The value must represent a path that is accessible to users (e.g. exported 
# through Samba).
# 
# This option can be specified multiple times in the file - once for each directory 
# to be designated as such. This option can be used when adding torrents via the 
# uTorrent HTTP interface, not via the SDK interface.
# 
# Use the action list-dirs to obtain a list of download directories from the uTorrent 
# HTTP interface. Use the option download_dir to specify which of these directories to 
# use when adding a torrent by URL or file through the uTorrent HTTP interface; 
# specify the one-based index of the entry of interest. The index of each entry will 
# be in order in which each entry appears in utserver.conf, starting with 1 for the 
# first entry, 2 for the second entry, and so on. 0 indicates the default download 
# directory should be used.
#
# dir_download: /home/<userid>/Downloads/
# dir_download: /home/<userid>/Music/
# dir_download: /home/<userid>/Videos/
 
# Directory where torrent files are stored. If the empty string, the value of 
# dir_active is used. It is recommended that this directory be hidden from users (i.e. 
# not exported through Samba).
#
# dir_torrent_files: /opt/utorrent/torrents
 
# Directory where temporary files are stored. If the empty string, the value of 
# dir_active is used. It is recommended that this directory be hidden from users 
# (i.e. not exported through Samba). Also, using a separate directory just for 
# temporary files allows for deleting the files in this directory on boot and/or 
# periodically. The utserver process creates temporary files with a .utt 
# extension - if a value for this setting is specified, the utserver process will 
# delete all files with that extension in that directory at process startup. This 
# setting applies only to POSIX systems. The value should specify a directory, not 
# a symbolic link to a directory.
#
dir_temp_files: /utorrent/tmp
 
# Directory where torrent files will be recognized and auto-loaded. If the empty 
# string, auto-load is disabled.
#
dir_autoload: /shared/torrent
 
# If true, torrent files in the autoload directory will be deleted after being 
# loaded, else they will be renamed with an extension of .loaded. The dir_autoload 
# setting must be specified for this setting to have an effect. The default value 
# is false.
#
dir_autoload_delete: true
 
# Directory where maintenance request files will be recognized, loaded, and deleted. 
# If the empty string, maintenance request handling is disabled. This directory 
# should be hidden from users (i.e., not exported through Samba). Your software 
# running on your device can create the following files in this directory in order 
# to request the following maintenance procedures.
#
# If the file c.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the credentials 
# necessary to access the uTorrent HTTP interface will be reset to username admin 
# and a blank password.
#
# If the file wipl.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the IP 
# restriction list that limits the IPs that can use the uTorrent HTTP interface is 
# cleared, so that there will be no restrictions on IP address.
#
# These maintenance operations provide a way to help a user who has either entered 
# new credentials and then forgotten them, or who has entered an IP range in the 
# restricted list and can no longer access the uTorrent HTTP interface as a result.
#
# If the file rcf.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the server will 
# reload the configuration file. If you always use this method to request a 
# configuration file reload, you can safely change the value of this setting while 
# the server is running.
#
# The server will also reload the configuration file if you send a hangup signal 
# to the server; however, a race condition may occur if you send a hangup signal to 
# the server in order to change the value of this setting. You should either only 
# use the file system interface for requesting configuration file reloads, or you 
# should not change the value of this setting in the configuration file before 
# sending a hangup signal to the server.
#
# dir_request: /opt/utorrent
 
# upnp (boolean): The default value is true. If true, UPNP functionality for 
# mapping ports is used by utserver. We recommend setting this value to true.
#
upnp: true

# limiting also applies to communications with peers in the local subnet. We 
# recommend setting this value to false.
#
rate_limit_local_peers: false
 
# If not empty, dir_active, dir_completed, and dir_torrent_files are relative 
# to this directory.
#
# dir_root: /var/utorrent
 
# disk_cache_max_size (integer): The default value is 0. Maximum amount of 
# memory used by each of the read, write, and piece caches. Value is in 
# megabytes. If 0, accepts the SDK's default choices on selecting sizes of 
# disk caches. Maximum value is 512. The value of this setting will be applied 
# every time the utserver process starts.
#
disk_cache_max_size: 0
 
# If defined, name of network interface to be preferred when attempting to 
# search among network interfaces for an external IP and hardware address. If 
# empty string, preferred interface is ignored.
#
# You need to provide a value for this setting if either 1) the toolchain for
# your computer does not supply ifaddrs.h, or 2) you want the utserver process 
# to choose a different interface than it would choose on its own. You should 
# set a value for this setting if you see an incorrect port mapping on a UPnP 
# router for the subnet to which the device belongs (the IP address of the 
# device will not appear in the port mapping requested by the utserver process. 
# Instead, the IP address associated with the mapping will be 0.0.0.0 with a 
# device having a toolchain that does not include ifaddrs.h, or some other IP 
# address with a device having a toolchain that includes ipaddrs.h).
#
# The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
# starts.
#
# preferred_interface: eth1
 
# admin_name (string): The default value is "admin". If defined, name that
# must be supplied (along with the password) when authenticating to the 
# server via the HTTP interface. This allows the administrator to define an 
# initial non-default value for this name. This value will not be applied 
# from utserver.conf if settings.dat already exists.
#
admin_name: admin
 
# admin_password (string): The default value is "". If defined, password 
# that must be supplied (along with the name) when authenticating to the 
# server via the HTTP interface. This allows the administrator to define an 
# initial non-default value for this password. This value will not be applied 
# from utserver.conf if settings.dat already exists.
#
admin_password:
 
# logmask (integer): The default value is 0. A mask whose bits when set allow 
# certain categories of log messages to be generated. The value of this 
# setting will be applied every time the utserver process starts.
#
# The bits (0 - 31) in the value of this setting correspond to a set of internal 
# events and subsystems. The usage of these bits may change without advance 
# notice in a future release.

# ut_webui_dir (string): The directory where the web UI file archive webui.zip 
# is stored, or which contains a webui subdirectory within which the unarchived 
# web UI files are stored. It can be an absolute path or set relative to the 
# current directory. It is recommended that this directory be hidden from users 
# (i.e. not exported through Samba). The default value is "" (to use the same 
# directory as settings.dat and other settings files).
#
# ut_webui_dir: /opt/utorrent
 
# finish_cmd (string), state_cmd (string): If defined, finish_cmd is a command 
# that will be executed upon completion of each torrent, and state_cmd is a 
# command that will be executed when a torrent changes state. Default value: "" 
# (no command is run for the event(s) associated with that setting).
#
# The command is run asynchronously, so that a lengthy or hung process will not 
# block the server. The server creates a new process group for the command, so 
# that the server does not need to wait for it, and so the kernel process table 
# does not fill up with zombie processes. The command is run as the same user 
# that runs the server process.
#
# The server permits substitutions in the command text as follows:
#
# %F  name of downloaded data file (for single-file torrents)
# %D  directory where torrent data files are saved
# %N  torrent title
# %S  torrent state
# %P  previous state of torrent
# %L  label associated with torrent
# %T  tracker
# %M  status message
# %I  hex-encoded info-hash
#
# State (%S) and previous state (%P) are integers that have the following values:
#
#  1 (error)
#  2 (checked)
